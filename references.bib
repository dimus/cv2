abstract = {BACKGROUND: A scientific name for an organism can be associated with almost all biological data. Name identification is an important step in many text mining tasks aiming to extract useful information from biological, biomedical and biodiversity text sources. A scientific name acts as an important metadata element to link biological information.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We present NetiNeti (Name Extraction from Textual Information-Name Extraction for Taxonomic Indexing), a machine learning based approach for recognition of scientific names including the discovery of new species names from text that will also handle misspellings, OCR errors and other variations in names. The system generates candidate names using rules for scientific names and applies probabilistic machine learning methods to classify names based on structural features of candidate names and features derived from their contexts. NetiNeti can also disambiguate scientific names from other names using the contextual information. We evaluated NetiNeti on legacy biodiversity texts and biomedical literature (MEDLINE). NetiNeti performs better (precision = 98.9{\%} and recall = 70.5{\%}) compared to a popular dictionary based approach (precision = 97.5{\%} and recall = 54.3{\%}) on a 600-page biodiversity book that was manually marked by an annotator. On a small set of PubMed Central's full text articles annotated with scientific names, the precision and recall values are 98.5{\%} and 96.2{\%} respectively. NetiNeti found more than 190,000 unique binomial and trinomial names in more than 1,880,000 PubMed records when used on the full MEDLINE database. NetiNeti also successfully identifies almost all of the new species names mentioned within web pages.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We present NetiNeti, a machine learning based approach for identification and discovery of scientific names.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The digitization of biodiversity data is leading to the widespread application of taxon names that are superfluous, ambiguous or incorrect, resulting in mismatched records and inflated species numbers. The ultimate consequences of misspelled names and bad taxonomy are erroneous scientific conclusions and faulty policy decisions. The lack of tools for correcting this 'names problem' has become a fundamental obstacle to integrating disparate data sources and advancing the progress of biodiversity science.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The TNRS, or Taxonomic Name Resolution Service, is an online application for automated and user-supervised standardization of plant scientific names. The TNRS builds upon and extends existing open-source applications for name parsing and fuzzy matching. Names are standardized against multiple reference taxonomies, including the Missouri Botanical Garden's Tropicos database. Capable of processing thousands of names in a single operation, the TNRS parses and corrects misspelled names and authorities, standardizes variant spellings, and converts nomenclatural synonyms to accepted names. Family names can be included to increase match accuracy and resolve many types of homonyms. Partial matching of higher taxa combined with extraction of annotations, accession numbers and morphospecies allows the TNRS to standardize taxonomy across a broad range of active and legacy datasets.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We show how the TNRS can resolve many forms of taxonomic semantic heterogeneity, correct spelling errors and eliminate spurious names. As a result, the TNRS can aid the integration of disparate biological datasets. Although the TNRS was developed to aid in standardizing plant names, its underlying algorithms and design can be extended to all organisms and nomenclatural codes.

abstract = {For 250 years, taxonomists have relied on having access to physical copies of published works in order to verifyinformation about taxa. The difficulty of tracking down publications can be a substantial impediment totaxonomic work, which has led some researchers to advocate modifying the codes of nomenclature, for plantsand bacteria as well as for animals, to allow electronic publication of scientific names (Knapp et al. 2007,Wheeler {\&} Krell 2007).Electronic publishing and access to online information can clearly accelerate progress in taxonomy(Wheeler 2008). Even when the fourth edition of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN1999) was published, it was clear that electronic publication could not be ignored (Ride 1999, 2003). In allfields of science, however, long-term access to digital information has been and remains a significant concern(Anonymous 2001, Howe et al. 2008, Szalay 2008). Botanists have rejected proposals for electronic publicationbecause of concerns for archiving and security from tampering (Zander 2004, McNeill 2006). Althoughsome works printed on paper are rare, the number of instances in which no copies are known to survive is vanishinglysmall, so it certainly has been possible to reliably archive paper copies. Will we be able to say thesame for electronic works 100 years from now? Can we have both rapid and effectively permanent access topublications and the information they contain?The International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) considered these issues at a specialsession in Paris, August 23-25, 2008, preceding the XXth International Congress of Zoology (ICZ). TheCommissioners voted to start the process required to amend the International Code of Zoological Nomenclatureto allow electronic publication of new scientific names and other nomenclatural acts. A summary of thedraft amendment was presented at the ICZ on August 27, during the Systema Naturae 250 symposium. Thedraft amendment was then refined via email discussion among Commissioners during the following month.In Paris, Commissioners voted separately in favour of three principles relating to publication. None ofthese passed unanimously, but all had at least a two-thirds majority among the twelve voting.},

The pressures are pervasive and chronic in many places invasive species, habitat loss and climate change in particular. But theres also good news. Every day we are making exciting new discoveries about the breadth and depth of Australias biodiversity. Since the first edition of the Numbers of Living Species in Australia and the World was produced in 2006, weve discovered 48 reptiles, about 200 new fish species and 1,184 flowering plants. Understanding of the global significance of Australias biodiversity is also on the increase. This comprehensive review of the endemism of Australias plants and animals shows that a greater percentage of our plants and animals are found nowhere else in the world. Reptile endemism has jumped from 89 to 93 per cent, mammals from 83 to 87 and frogs from 93 to 94. And close to 92 per cent of our vascular plants, up from 90 per cent, are unique to Australia. It is vital that we forge new and innovative ways of conserving and protecting this unique biodiversity at a landscape level. Harnessing core science and knowledge bases, like this report, will be key to creating new ways of meeting Australias biodiversity challenges. Importantly, they provide a benchmark for assessing and monitoring the future effects of climate change on Australias biodiversity. As we move into the International Year of Biodiversity in 2010, Australia has the opportunity to show global leadership in biodiversity conservation. This report, the only one of its kind in the world, is a positive start.},

Since then, the relative number of marine to terrestrial species described per year has increased, reflecting the less explored nature of the oceans. From the mid-19th century, the cumulative number of species described has been linear, with the highest number of species described in the decade of 1900, and fewer species described and fewer authors active during the World Wars. There were more authors describing species since the 1960s, indicating greater taxonomic effort. There were fewer species described per author since the 1920s, suggesting it has become more difficult to discover new species. There was no evidence of any change in individual effort by taxonomists. Using a nonhomogeneous renewal process model we predicted that 24–31{\%} to 21–29{\%} more marine and terrestrial species remain to be discovered, respectively. We discuss why we consider that marine species comprise only 16{\%} of all species on Earth although the oceans contain a greater phylogenetic diversity than occurs on land. We predict that there may be 1.8–2.0 million species on Earth, of which about 0.3 million are marine, significantly less than some previous estimates.},

abstract = {During the post-Darwinian history of taxonomy, the Linnaean hierarchy has maintained its role as a means for representing hierarchical taxonomic relationships. During the same period, the principle of descent has taken on an increasingly important role as the basis for reformulated versions of fundamental taxonomic concepts and principles. Early in this history, the principle of descent provided an explanation for the existence of taxa and implied a nested, hierarchical structure for taxonomic relationships. Although an evolutionary explanation for taxa contradicted the Aristotelian context within which the Linnaean hierarchy was developed, the nested, hierarchical structure of taxonomic relationships implied by evolution was compatible with the practical use of the Linnaean hierarchy for conveying hierarchical relationships and seems to have reinforced this practice. Later changes associated with the development of taxon concepts based on the principle of descent led to changes in the interpretation of the Linnaean categories as well as certain modifications related to use of the Linnaean hierarchy in representing phylogenetic relationships. Although some authors questioned use of the Linnaean hierarchy in phylogenetic taxonomies, most continued to use it in one form or another. More recently, taxonomists have considered the relevance of the principle of descent to nomenclature. They have found fundamental inconsistencies between concepts of taxa based on that principle and methods currently used to define taxon names, which are based on the Linnaean hierarchy. Although these inconsistencies can be corrected without totally eliminating the Linnaean hierarchy, the necessary changes would greatly reduce the importance of that hierarchy, particularly in the area of nomenclature. Moreover, the earlier development of taxon concepts based on the principle of descent effectively proposed taxonomic categories of greater theoretical significance than those of the Linnaean hierarchy. The historical trend of granting increasing importance to the principle of descent has reduced the significance of the Linnaean hierarchy to the point where it may no longer be worth retaining.},

abstract = {The recent multiplication of cladistic hypotheses for many zoological groups poses a challenge to zoological nomenclature following the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature: in order to account for these hypotheses, we will need many more ranks than currently allowed in this system, especially in lower taxonomy (around the ranks genus and species). The current Code allows the use of as many ranks as necessary in the family-series of nomina (except above superfamily), but forbids the use of more than a few ranks in the genus and species-series. It is here argued that this limitation has no theoretical background, does not respect the freedom of taxonomic thoughts or actions, and is harmful to zoological taxonomy in two respects at least: (1) it does not allow to express in detail hypothesized cladistic relationships among taxa at lower taxonomic levels (genus and species); (2) it does not allow to point taxonomically to low-level differentiation between populations of the same species, although this would be useful in some cases for conservation biology purposes. It is here proposed to modify the rules of the Code in order to allow use by taxonomists of an indeterminate number of ranks in all nominal-series. Such an 'expanded nomenclatural system' would be highly flexible and likely to be easily adapted to any new finding or hypothesis regarding cladistic relationships between taxa, at genus and species level and below. This system could be useful for phylogeographic analysis and in conservation biology. In zoological nomenclature, whereas robustness of nomina is necessary, the same does not hold for nomenclatural ranks, as the latter are arbitrary and carry no special biological, evolutionary or other information, except concerning the mutual relationships between taxa in the taxonomic hierarchy. Compared to the Phylocode project, the new system is equally unambiguous within the frame of a given taxonomic frame, but it provides more explicit and informative nomina for non-specialist users, and is more economic in terms of number of nomina needed to account for a given hierarchy. These ideas are exemplified by a comparative study of three possible nomenclatures for the taxonomy recently proposed by Hillis and Wilcox (2005) for American frogs traditionally referred to the genus Rana.

abstract = {The advent of relational databasing and data storage capacity, coupled with revolutionary advances in molecular sequencing technology and specimen imaging, have led to a taxonomic renaissance. Systema Naturae 250 - The Linnaean Ark maps the origins of this renaissance, beginning with Linnaeus, through his "apostles", via the great unsung hero Charles Davies Sherbon — arguably the father of biodiversity informatics — up to the present day with the Planetary Biodiversity Inventories and into the future with the Encyclopedia of Life and web-based taxonomy. The book provides scientific, historical, and cultural documentation of the evolution of taxonomy and the successful adaptation of the Linnaean nomenclature system to that evolution. It underscores the importance of taxonomic accuracy, not only for the classification of living organisms, but for a more complete understanding of the living world and its biodiversity. The book also examines the role of technologies such as DNA sequencing, specimen imaging, and electronic data storage.A celebration of 250 years of the scientific naming of animals, Systema Naturae 250 - The Linnaean Ark records and explores the history of zoological nomenclature and taxonomy, detailing current and future activity in these fields. Descriptive taxonomy has been in decline, despite the fact that the classification of organisms through taxonomic studies provides the foundation of our understanding of life forms. Packed with illustrations and tables, this book establishes a vision for the future of descriptive taxonomy and marks the beginning of a period of rapid growth of taxonomic knowledge.},

However, taxonomy is usually described as a science in crisis, lacking manpower and funding, a politically acknowledged problem known as the Taxonomic Impediment. Using data from the Fauna Europaea database and the Zoological Record, we show that contrary to general belief, developed and heavily-studied parts of the world are important reservoirs of unknown species. In Europe, new species of multicellular terrestrial and freshwater animals are being discovered and named at an unprecedented rate: since the 1950s, more than 770 new species are on average described each year from Europe, which add to the 125,000 terrestrial and freshwater multicellular species already known in this region. There is no sign of having reached a plateau that would allow for the assessment of the magnitude of European biodiversity. More remarkably, over 60{\%} of these new species are described by non-professional taxonomists. Amateurs are recognized as an essential part of the workforce in ecology and astronomy, but the magnitude of non-professional taxonomist contributions to alpha-taxonomy has not been fully realized until now. Our results stress the importance of developing a system that better supports and guides this formidable workforce, as we seek to overcome the Taxonomic Impediment and speed up the process of describing the planetary biodiversity before it is too late.},

abstract = {Packrat parsing is a novel technique for implementing parsers in a lazy functional programming language. A packrat parser provides the power and flexibility of top-down parsing with backtracking and unlimited lookahead, but nevertheless guarantees linear parse time. Any language defined by an LL(k) or LR(k) grammar can be recognized by a packrat parser, in addition to many languages that conventional linear-time algorithms do not support. This additional power simplifies the handling of common syntactic idioms such as the widespread but troublesome longest-match rule, enables the use of sophisticated disambiguation strategies such as syntactic and semantic predicates, provides better grammar composition properties, and allows lexical analysis to be integrated seamlessly into parsing. Yet despite its power, packrat parsing shares the same simplicity and elegance as recursive descent parsing; in fact converting a backtracking recursive descent parser into a linear-time packrat parser often involves only a fairly straightforward structural change. This paper describes packrat parsing informally with emphasis on its use in practical applications, and explores its advantages and disadvantages with respect to the more conventional alternatives.},

@inproceedings{Ford2004,
abstract = {For decades we have been using Chomsky's generative system of grammars, particularly context-free grammars (CFGs) and regular expressions (REs), to express the syntax of programming languages and protocols. The power of generative grammars to express ambiguity is crucial to their original purpose of modelling natural languages, but this very power makes it unnecessarily difficult both to express and to parse machine-oriented languages using CFGs. Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs) provide an alternative, recognition-based formal foundation for describing machine-oriented syntax, which solves the ambiguity problem by not introducing ambiguity in the first place. Where CFGs express nondeterministic choice between alternatives, PEGs instead use prioritized choice. PEGs address frequently felt expressiveness limitations of CFGs and REs, simplifying syntax definitions and making it unnecessary to separate their lexical and hierarchical components. A linear-time parser can be built for any PEG, avoiding both the complexity and fickleness of LR parsers and the inefficiency of generalized CFG parsing. While PEGs provide a rich set of operators for constructing grammars, they are reducible to two minimal recognition schemas developed around 1970, TS/TDPL and gTS/GTDPL, which are here proven equivalent in effective recognition power.},

abstract = {Taxonomic concepts (sensu Berendsohn) embody the underlying mean-  ings of scientific names as stated in a particular publication, thus offering a new way  to resolve semantic ambiguities that result from multiple revisions of a taxonomic  name. This paper presents a comprehensive and powerful language for representing  the relationships among taxonomic concepts. The language features terms and sym-  bols for concept relationships within a single taxonomic hierarchy, or between two  related but independently published hierarchies. Taxonomic concepts pertaining to a  single hierarchy are characterised by parent/child relationships, whereas those per-  taining to two independent hierarchies may have the following basic relationships:  congruence, inclusion (non-symmetrical, relative to the side of comparison), overlap,  and exclusion. The relationships are asserted by specialists who have the option to  add or subtract concepts on one or both sides of a relationship equation in order  to reconcile differences between non-congruent taxonomic perspectives. The terms  ‘and’, ‘or’ and ‘not’ are available, respectively, to connect multiple simultaneously  or alternatively valid relationship assessments, or to explicitly negate the validity  of a relationship. The language also permits the decomposition of a relationship  according to the intensional (property referencing) and ostensive (member pointing)  aspects of the compared taxonomic concepts. Adopting the concept relationship  language will facilitate a more precise documentation of similarities and differences  in multiple succeeding taxonomic perspectives, thereby preparing the stage for an  ontology-based integration of taxonomic and related biological information.  },

abstract = {A considerable number of research projects are exploring how to extend object-oriented programming languages such as Java with, for example, support for generics, multiple dispatch, or pattern matching. To keep up with these changes, language implementors need appropriate tools. In this context, easily extensible parser generators are especially important because parsing program sources is a necessary first step for any language processor, be it a compiler, syntax-highlighting editor, or API documentation generator. Unfortunately, context-free grammars and the corresponding LR or LL parsers, while well understood and widely used, are also unnecessarily hard to extend. To address this lack of appropriate tools, we introduce Rats!, a parser generator for Java that supports easily modifiable grammars and avoids the complexities associated with altering LR or LL grammars. Our work builds on recent research on packrat parsers, which are recursive descent parsers that perform backtracking but also memoize all intermediate results (hence their name), thus ensuring linear-time performance. Our work makes this parsing technique, which has been developed in the context of functional programming languages, practical for object-oriented languages. Furthermore, our parser generator supports simpler grammar specifications and more convenient error reporting, while also producing better performing parsers through aggressive optimizations. In this paper, we motivate the need for more easily extensible parsers, describe our parser generator and its optimizations in detail, and present the results of our experimental evaluation.},

abstract = {Parsing, also referred to as syntax analysis, has been and continues to be an essential part of computer science and linguistics. Today, parsing techniques are also implemented in a number of other disciplines, including but not limited to, document preparation and conversion, typesetting chemical formulae, and chromosome recognition. This second edition presents new developments and discoveries that have been made in the field. Parsing techniques have grown considerably in importance, both in computational linguistics where such parsers are the only option, and computer science, where advanced compilers often use general CF parsers. Parsing techniques provide a solid basis for compiler construction and contribute to all existing software: enabling Web browsers to analyze HTML pages and PostScript printers to analyze PostScript. Some of the more advanced techniques are used in code generation in compilers and in data compression. In linguistics, the importance of formal grammars was recognized early on, but only recently have the corresponding parsing techniques been applied. Also their importance as general pattern recognizers is slowly being acknowledged. This text Parsing Techniques explores new developments, such as generalized deterministic parsing, linear-time substring parsing, parallel parsing, parsing as intersection, non-canonical methods, and non-Chomsky systems. To provide readers with low-threshold access to the full field of parsing techniques, this new edition uses a two-tiered structure. The basic ideas behind the dozen or so existing parsing techniques are explained in an intuitive and narrative style, and problems are presented at the conclusion of each chapter, allowing the reader to step outside the bounds of the covered material and explore parsing techniques at various levels. The reader is also provided with an extensive annotated bibliography as well as hints and partial solutions to a number of problems. In the bibliography, hundreds of realizations and improvements of parsing techniques are explained in a much terser, yet still informal, style, improving its readability and usability. The reader should have an understanding of algorithmic thinking, especially recursion; however, knowledge of any particular programming language is not required.},

abstract = {Biodiversity informatics plays a central enabling role in the research community's efforts to address scientific conservation and sustainability issues. Great strides have been made in the past decade establishing a framework for sharing data, where taxonomy and systematics has been perceived as the most prominent discipline involved. To some extent this is inevitable, given the use of species names as the pivot around which information is organised. To address the urgent questions around conservation, land-use, environmental change, sustainability, food security and ecosystem services that are facing Governments worldwide, we need to understand how the ecosystem works. So, we need a systems approach to understanding biodiversity that moves significantly beyond taxonomy and species observations. Such an approach needs to look at the whole system to address species interactions, both with their environment and with other species.It is clear that some barriers to progress are sociological, basically persuading people to use the technological solutions that are already available. This is best addressed by developing more effective systems that deliver immediate benefit to the user, hiding the majority of the technology behind simple user interfaces. An infrastructure should be a space in which activities take place and, as such, should be effectively invisible.This community consultation paper positions the role of biodiversity informatics, for the next decade, presenting the actions needed to link the various biodiversity infrastructures invisibly and to facilitate understanding that can support both business and policy-makers. The community considers the goal in biodiversity informatics to be full integration of the biodiversity research community, including citizens' science, through a commonly-shared, sustainable e-infrastructure across all sub-disciplines that reliably serves science and society alike.},

abstract = {For 250 years, taxonomists have relied on having access to physical copies of published works in order to verify information about taxa. The difficulty of tracking down publications can be a substantial impediment to taxonomic work, which has led some researchers to advocate modifying the codes of nomenclature, for plants and bacteria as well as for animals, to allow electronic publication of scientific names (Knapp et al. 2007, Wheeler {\&} Krell 2007). Electronic publishing and access to online information can clearly accelerate progress in taxonomy (Wheeler 2008). Even when the fourth edition of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN 1999) was published, it was clear that electronic publication could not be ignored (Ride 1999, 2003). In all fields of science, however, long-term access to digital information has been and remains a significant concern (Anonymous 2001, Howe et al. 2008, Szalay 2008). Botanists have rejected proposals for electronic publication because of concerns for archiving and security from tampering (Zander 2004, McNeill 2006). Although some works printed on paper are rare, the number of instances in which no copies are known to survive is vanishingly small, so it certainly has been possible to reliably archive paper copies. Will we be able to say the same for electronic works 100 years from now? Can we have both rapid and effectively permanent access to publications and the information they contain?},

At the same time these compounds did not demonstrate the properties of a terminating substrate in DNA synthesis catalyzed by human DNA polymerases $\alpha$, , and I from E. coli.Download full textRelated$\backslash$n    $\backslash$n            $\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n    $\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n    $\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n    var addthis{\_}config = {\{}$\backslash$n        ui{\_}cobrand: "Taylor {\&}amp; Francis Online",$\backslash$n        services{\_}compact: "citeulike,netvibes,twitter,technorati,delicious,linkedin,facebook,stumbleupon,digg,google,more",$\backslash$n        pubid: "ra-4dff56cd6bb1830b"$\backslash$n    {\}};$\backslash$n$\backslash$n                $\backslash$n                $\backslash$n                $\backslash$n                More Sharing Services$\backslash$n                $\backslash$n                var addthis{\_}config = {\{}"data{\_}track{\_}addressbar":true,"ui{\_}click":true{\}};$\backslash$n        $\backslash$n            $\backslash$n                    $\backslash$n                        Add to shortlist$\backslash$n                    $\backslash$n                $\backslash$n$\backslash$n        $\backslash$n$\backslash$n        $\backslash$n            $\backslash$n                $\backslash$n                        $\backslash$n                            Link$\backslash$n                        $\backslash$n$\backslash$n                        $\backslash$n                            $\backslash$n                                $\backslash$n                                    Permalink$\backslash$n                                $\backslash$n$\backslash$n                                $\backslash$n                                    $\backslash$n                                    $\backslash$n$\backslash$n                                    $\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n                                    $\backslash$n                                        $\backslash$n                                    $\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n                                    $\backslash$n                                    $\backslash$n                                            http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15257779508014650$\backslash$n                                    $\backslash$n                                $\backslash$n                            $\backslash$n                            $\backslash$n                            $\backslash$n                        $\backslash$n                    $\backslash$n            $\backslash$n        $\backslash$n$\backslash$n        $\backslash$n            $\backslash$n                $\backslash$n                        $\backslash$n                            Download Citation$\backslash$n                        $\backslash$n                    $\backslash$n$\backslash$n            $\backslash$n        $\backslash$n    $\backslash$n            Recommend to:$\backslash$n        $\backslash$n        $\backslash$n            $\backslash$n                    $\backslash$n                $\backslash$n$\backslash$n            $\backslash$n$\backslash$n            $\backslash$n                $\backslash$n                $\backslash$n                $\backslash$n                $\backslash$n$\backslash$n                A friend},

The standardized sequence region is called a DNA barcode because it is like a barcode tag for each taxon. Since the proposition of this concept and the launch of a large project named the Barcode of Life, this simple technique has attracted attention from taxonomists, ecologists, conservation biologists, agriculturists, plant-quarantine officers and others, and the number of studies using the DNA barcode has rapidly increased. The extreme diversity of insects and their economical, epidemiological and agricultural importance have made this group a major target of DNA barcoding. However, there is some controversy about the utility of DNA barcoding. In this review, we present an overview of DNA barcoding and its application to entomology. We also introduce current advances and future implications of this promising technique.},

L-ddCTP was not a substrate or inhibitor for any DNA polymerase studied; L-FddCTP was not an inhibitor or substrate for replicative DNA polymerases and was a less potent inhibitor of DNA polymerases gamma and beta than its D-enantiomer by 2 orders of magnitude. In contrast, all L-dioxolane analogs were potent inhibitors and chain terminators for all cellular DNA polymerases studied. The Ki values of their 5'-triphosphates for DNA polymerase gamma were found to be in the following order: D-ddC < D-FddC L-OddC D-FOddC < L-FOddC << L-FddC. The Ki values of L-OddCTP for the reactions catalyzed by DNA polymerases alpha, delta, epsilon, beta, and gamma were 6.0, 1.9, 0.4, 3.0, and 0.014 microM, respectively, and those of L-FOddCTP were 6.5, 1.9, 0.7, 19, and 0.06 microM, respectively. The Km values for incorporation of L-OddCTP into the standing points of primer extension were also evaluated and determined to be 1.3, 3.5, 1.5, 2.8, and 0.7 microM for DNA polymerases alpha, delta, epsilon, beta, and gamma, respectively.

These standardized syndication formats deliver content directly to the subscriber, allowing them to locally aggregate content from a variety of sources instead of having to find the information on multiple websites. The uBioRSS application is a 'taxonomically intelligent' service customized for the biological sciences. It aggregates syndicated content from academic publishers and science news feeds, and then uses a taxonomic Named Entity Recognition algorithm to identify and index taxonomic names within those data streams. The resulting name index is cross-referenced to current global taxonomic datasets to provide context for browsing the publications by taxonomic group. This process, called taxonomic indexing, draws upon services developed specifically for biological sciences, collectively referred to as 'taxonomic intelligence'.

We begin by observing that the Penn Treebank (PTB) is lexically impoverished when measured on various genres of scientific and technical writing, and that this significantly impacts parse accuracy. To resolve this without requiring in-domain treebank data, we show how existing domain-specific lexical resources may be leveraged to augment PTB-training: part-of-speech tags, dictionary collocations, and named-entities. Using a state-of-the-art statistical parser [3] as our baseline, our lexically-adapted parser achieves a 14.2{\%} reduction in error. With oracle-knowledge of named-entities, this error reduction improves to 21.2{\%}. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

abstract = {Three direct assays, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-band mobility shift, agarose gel electrophoresis-band mobility shift, and nitrocellulose filter binding, were established to study complexes formed among mammalian DNA polymerase delta (pol delta), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and synthetic oligonucleotide template-primers. In all contexts, complex formation requires simultaneous presence of pol delta, PCNA, and template-primer. Moreover, we showed in one such assay that the complex formed contains each molecular component. Nuclease protection experiments demonstrate that complex formation protects template from degradation by DNase I. The mass determined for the pol delta.PCNA.template-primer complex was about 267 kDa, consistent with the participation of one molecule of pol delta, two or three molecules of PCNA and one molecule of template-primer. PCNA alone behaved as a trimer (mass determined to be about 87 kDa). Complex could be manipulated enzymologically. Measurement of off rates demonstrates directly that PCNA stabilizes the pol delta.template-primer complex.},

abstract = {The diversity of life is one of the most striking aspects of our planet; hence knowing how many species inhabit Earth is among the most fundamental questions in science. Yet the answer to this question remains enigmatic, as efforts to sample the world's biodiversity to date have been limited and thus have precluded direct quantification of global species richness, and because indirect estimates rely on assumptions that have proven highly controversial. Here we show that the higher taxonomic classification of species (i.e., the assignment of species to phylum, class, order, family, and genus) follows a consistent and predictable pattern from which the total number of species in a taxonomic group can be estimated. This approach was validated against well-known taxa, and when applied to all domains of life, it predicts ∼8.7 million (±1.3 million SE) eukaryotic species globally, of which ∼2.2 million (±0.18 million SE) are marine. In spite of 250 years of taxonomic classification and over 1.2 million species already catalogued in a central database, our results suggest that some 86{\%} of existing species on Earth and 91{\%} of species in the ocean still await description. Renewed interest in further exploration and taxonomy is required if this significant gap in our knowledge of life on Earth is to be closed.},

By defining only five terms as mandatory, it seeks to lighten the burden for providing or using multimedia useful for biodiversity science. At the same time it offers rich optional metadata terms that can help curators of multimedia collections provide authoritative media that document species occurrence, ecosystems, identification tools, ontologies, and many other kinds of biodiversity documents or data. About half of the vocabulary is re-used from other relevant controlled vocabularies that are often already in use for multimedia metadata, thereby reducing the mapping burden on existing repositories. A central design goal is to allow consuming applications to have a high likelihood of discovering suitable resources, reducing the human examination effort that might be required to decide if the resource is fit for the purpose of the application.},

abstract = {DNA polymerase epsilon (pol epsilon) was purified to apparent homogeneity from human placentas. The purified enzyme contains a single polypeptide of approximately 170 kDa (apparent mass) and has both DNA polymerase and 3'-5'-exonuclease activities. Competitive inhibition studies indicate that like DNA polymerases alpha and delta (pol alpha and pol delta, respectively), free pol epsilon binds single-stranded but not double-stranded DNA. This conclusion was confirmed by sedimentation binding analysis. Also like pol alpha and pol beta, pol epsilon exhibits induced dNTP inhibition in the presence of template annealed to complementary primer containing a 2',3'-H (dideoxy)-terminus. Together, these data suggest that pol epsilon follows an ordered sequential ter-reactant mechanism of substrate recognition and binding; it binds template first followed by annealed primer and then template-specified dNTP. Enzymologic studies suggest that in contrast to both pol alpha and pol delta, pol epsilon functions more efficiently as gap size decreases. This observation is consistent with a specific role for pol epsilon in gap-filling in vivo. Gap-filling is essential for both replication and repair.},

abstract = {A proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-dependent complex, detectable after nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, is formed between calf thymus DNA polymerase delta (pol delta) and synthetic oligonucleotide template-primers containing a mispaired nucleotide at the 3'-terminal position of the primer. This complex is indistinguishable in composition from that formed with a fully base paired template-primer. Extension of a mispaired primer terminus is a component of DNA polymerase fidelity. The fidelity of pol delta on synthetic oligonucleotide template-primers was compared with and without its specific processivity factor, PCNA. In the absence of PCNA, pol delta misincorporates less than one nucleotide for every 100,000 nucleotides incorporated correctly. Addition of PCNA to reactions reduces fidelity by at least 27-fold. PCNA also confers upon pol delta, the ability to incorporate (and/or not excise) the dTTP analog, 2'-deoxythymidine-5'-O-(alpha-phosphonomethyl)-beta, gamma-diphosphate. A model is proposed whereby the increased stability (decreased off-rate) of the pol delta.template-primer complex in the presence of PCNA facilitates unfavorable events catalyzed by pol delta. This model suggests an explicit mechanistic requirement for the intrinsic 3'-5'-exonuclease of pol delta.},

This synthesis is potentially mutagenic. The model abasic site was studied most extensively. When all deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates and a template bearing a model abasic site were present, DNA synthesis by pol delta beyond this site was stimulated 53-fold by addition of homologous PCNA. On an unmodified template (lacking any lesions), PCNA stimulated pol delta by 1.3-fold. Product analysis demonstrated that as expected from the "A-rule," fully and near-fully extended primers incorporated predominantly dAMP opposite the template lesion. Moreover, corollary primer extension studies demonstrated that in the presence (but not the absence) of PCNA, pol delta preferentially elongated primers containing dAMP opposite the model abasic template site. p21, a specific inhibitor of PCNA-dependent DNA replication, inhibits PCNA-stimulated synthesis past model abasic template sites. We propose that DNA synthesis past template lesions by pol delta promoted by PCNA results from the fundamental mechanism by which PCNA stimulates pol delta, i.e., stabilization of the pol delta. template-primer complex.},

abstract = {The relative positions of components of the DNA-dependent DNA polymerase delta (pol delta).proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA).DNA complex were studied. We have shown that pol delta incorporates nucleotides close to a template biotin-streptavidin complex located 5' (downstream) to the replicating complex in the presence or absence of PCNA. PCNA-dependent synthesis catalyzed by pol delta was nearly totally (95{\%}) inhibited by a biotin. streptavidin complex located at the 3'-end of a template with a 15-mer primer (upstream of the replicating complex), but was only partially inhibited with a 19-mer primer. With either primer, PCNA-independent synthesis was not affected by the biotin. streptavidin complex. Quantification of results with primers of varying length suggested that pol delta interacts with between 8 and 10 nucleotides of duplex DNA immediately proximal to the 3'-OH primer terminus. Using UV photocross-linking, we determined that the 125-kDa subunit of pol delta, but not the 50-kDa subunit, interacted with a photosensitive residue of a substrate oligonucleotide. Interaction apparently takes place through the C terminus of p125. Based on these results, we conclude that PCNA is located "behind" pol delta in the polymerization complex during DNA synthesis and that only the large subunit of pol delta (two-subunit form) interacts directly with DNA. A detailed model of the enzymatically active complex is proposed.},

An NH(2)-terminally His-tagged but otherwise wild-type Drosophila PCNA, as well as mutant His-tagged PCNA, were also engineered and purified to apparent homogeneity. Finally, an in situ polyacrylamide gel technique allows DNA polymerase assays to be performed on portions of single adults as well as single Drosophila embryos.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We and others have shown four distinct and presumably related effects of mammalian proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) on DNA synthesis catalyzed by mammalian DNA polymerase delta(pol delta). In the presence of homologous PCNA, pol delta exhibits 1) increased absolute activity; 2) increased processivity of DNA synthesis; 3) stable binding of synthetic oligonucleotide template-primers (t1/2 of the pol deltaPCNAtemplate-primer complex >/=2.5 h); and 4) enhanced synthesis of DNA opposite and beyond template base lesions. This last effect is potentially mutagenic in vivo. Biochemical studies performed in parallel with in vivo genetic analyses, would represent an extremely powerful approach to investigate further, both DNA replication and repair in eukaryotes. RESULTS: Drosophila PCNA, although highly similar in structure to mammalian PCNA (e.g., it is >70{\%} identical to human PCNA in amino acid sequence), can only substitute poorly for either calf thymus or human PCNA (approximately 10{\%} as well) in affecting calf thymus pol delta. However, by mutating one or only a few amino acids in the region of Drosophila PCNA thought to interact with pol delta, all four effects can be enhanced dramatically. CONCLUSIONS: Our results therefore suggest that all four above effects depend at least in part on the PCNA-pol delta interaction. Moreover unlike mammals, Drosophila offers the potential for immediate in vivo genetic analyses. Although it has proven difficult to obtain sufficient amounts of homologous pol delta for parallel in vitro biochemical studies, by altering Drosophila PCNA using site-directed mutagenesis as suggested by our results, in vitro biochemical studies may now be performed using human and/or calf thymus pol delta preparations.},

This opens up the prospect of using technologies developed for the Semantic Web to add “taxonomic intelligence” to biodiversity databases.

Taxonomic indexing was introduced to help manage the increasing amounts of digital information about biology. It has been designed to form a near basal layer in a layered cyberinfrastructure that deals with biological information. Taxonomic Indexing accommodates the special problems of using names of organisms to index biological material. It links alternative names for the same entity (reconciliation), and distinguishes between uses of the same name for different entities (disambiguation), and names are placed within an indefinite number of hierarchical schemes. In order to access all information on all organisms, Taxonomic indexing must be able to call on a registry of all names in all forms for all organisms. NameBank has been developed to meet that need. Taxonomic indexing is an area of informatics that overlaps with taxonomy, is dependent on the expert input of taxonomists, and reveals the relevance of the discipline to a wide audience.},

The four papers were created in different ways: (i) written in Microsoft Word and submitted as non-tagged manuscript (doi: 10.3897/zookeys.50.504); (ii) generated from Scratchpads and submitted as XML-tagged manuscripts (doi: 10.3897/zookeys.50.505 and doi: 10.3897/zookeys.50.506); (iii) generated from an author's database (doi: 10.3897/zookeys.50.485) and submitted as XML-tagged manuscript. XML tagging and semantic enhancements were implemented during the editorial process of ZooKeys using the Pensoft Mark Up Tool (PMT), specially designed for this purpose. The XML schema used was TaxPub, an extension to the Document Type Definitions (DTD) of the US National Library of Medicine Journal Archiving and Interchange Tag Suite (NLM). The following innovative methods of tagging, layout, publishing and disseminating the content were tested and implemented within the ZooKeys editorial workflow: (1) highly automated, fine-grained XML tagging based on TaxPub; (2) final XML output of the paper validated against the NLM DTD for archiving in PubMedCentral; (3) bibliographic metadata embedded in the PDF through XMP (Extensible Metadata Platform); (4) PDF uploaded after publication to the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL); (5) taxon treatments supplied through XML to Plazi; (6) semantically enhanced HTML version of the paper encompassing numerous internal and external links and linkouts, such as: (i) vizualisation of main tag elements within the text (e.g., taxon names, taxon treatments, localities, etc.); (ii) internal cross-linking between paper sections, citations, references, tables, and figures; (iii) mapping of localities listed in the whole paper or within separate taxon treatments; (v) taxon names autotagged, dynamically mapped and linked through the Pensoft Taxon Profile (PTP) to large international database services and indexers such as Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Barcode of Life (BOLD), Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), ZooBank, Wikipedia, Wikispecies, Wikimedia, and others; (vi) GenBank accession numbers autotagged and linked to NCBI; (vii) external links of taxon names to references in PubMed, Google Scholar, Biodiversity Heritage Library and other sources. With the launching of the working example, ZooKeys becomes the first taxonomic journal to provide a complete XML-based editorial, publication and dissemination workflow implemented as a routine and cost-efficient practice. It is anticipated that XML-based workflow will also soon be implemented in botany through PhytoKeys, a forthcoming partner journal of ZooKeys. The semantic markup and enhancements are expected to greatly extend and accelerate the way taxonomic information is published, disseminated and used.},

abstract = {Taxonomic research, as a field of biological sciences, is fundamentally an exercise in information management. Modern computer technology offers the potential for both streamlining the taxo- nomic process, and increasing its accuracy. Effective use of computer technology to successfully manage taxonomic information is predicated upon the implementation of data models that accommodate the diverse forms of information important to taxonomic researchers. Although sophisticated data models have been developed to manage some information relevant to taxo- nomic research (e.g., natural history specimen information; descriptive data relating to morpho- logical and molecular characters of specimens), similarly robust models for managing information about taxonomic names and how they are applied to taxonomic concepts, though they exist, have not attained widespread use and adoption. Herein I describe portions of a relational data model developed to manage information relevant to taxonomic names and concepts. The core entities of the described portions of this model are Agents, References, and Assertions (along with their associated Protonyms). Agents (people and organizations) in this context refer primarily to taxonomic authorities. References are broadly defined as date-stamped information (usually, but not exclusively, in the form of a publication), as documented by the Agents who serve as the Reference authors. Assertions consist of basic elemental information about the treatment of taxonomic names by taxonomic authorities as documented in a particular Reference, and correspond to what many authors refer to as taxon “concepts”. Protonyms are a special subset (subtype) of Assertions, which constitute original descriptions of taxonomic names (serving to unite multiple assertions pertaining to the same taxonomic name), and include elements of botanical Protologues and Basionyms. I also illustrate how these core entities can serve as a foundation for taxonomic names and concepts as integrated with other datasets, such as biological specimens and observations (and, by extension, geographic distributions and character matrices). The broadest data content source used to populate and test the data model is derived from a systematic revision of the reef-fish family Pomacanthidae (marine angelfishes). Additional datasets used to test the imple- mentation of the data model include specimen data from the Department of Natural Sciences, Bishop Museum; nomenclatural data from The Catalog of Fishes; and nomenclatural and bio- geographic data from two published taxonomic catalogs (insects and terrestrial mollusks in Hawai‘i). An intuitive, feature-rich software application based on Microsoft Access® has also been devel- oped in conjunction with this data model, and will be the topic of a future article. 1},

abstract = {Nomenclature represents the backbone upon which virtually all biological information is organized. However, the practice of zoological nomenclature has changed relatively little since its start in 1758. As modern technology changes the paradigm under which modern scientists exchange information, there is increasing need to capitalize on these same technologies to fortify nomenclature. ZooBank has been proposed as the official registry of names and nomenclatural acts, in zoology, as well as associated published works and their authors, and type specimens. Having a coordinated registry of zoological names, integrated with the existing Code of Zoological Nomenclature, will allow increased efficiency of communication among biologists, and enhanced stability of names. Such a registry would encompass two distinct realms, each with their own set of challenges. Retrospective registration involves the monumental task of aggregating and validating two and a half centuries of existing names, whereas prospective registration must be tightly integrated with the future paradigm in which scientific names are created and managed under new models of publication. The prototype of ZooBank has been hosted at Bishop Museum during its initial development phase. Following the lead of standard-setting bodies in biodiversity informatics, Life Science Identifiers (LSIDs) have been selected for use as the globally unique identifiers for ZooBank registration entries. The first ZooBank LSIDs were issued on January 1(st), 2008, and included five new fish species described in a work published that same day, as well as all 4,819 names established in the 10(th) Edition of Linnaeus' Systema Naturae. Three alternate scenarios for implementing mandatory registration in ZooBank have been articulated, each incorporating different degrees of coordination between published works and registration events. A robust discussion involving a broad spectrum of practicing zoological taxonomists is required over the next several years to define the specific implementation aspects of ZooBank.},

abstract = {Because many animal species are undescribed, and because the identification of known species is often difficult, interim taxonomic nomenclature has often been used in biodiversity analysis. By assigning individuals to presumptive species, called operational taxonomic units (OTUs), these systems speed investigations into the patterning of biodiversity and enable studies that would otherwise be impossible. Although OTUs have conventionally been separated through their morphological divergence, DNA-based delineations are not only feasible, but have important advantages. OTU designation can be automated, data can be readily archived, and results can be easily compared among investigations. This study exploits these attributes to develop a persistent, species-level taxonomic registry for the animal kingdom based on the analysis of patterns of nucleotide variation in the barcode region of the cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene. It begins by examining the correspondence between groups of specimens identified to a species through prior taxonomic work and those inferred from the analysis of COI sequence variation using one new (RESL) and four established (ABGD, CROP, GMYC, jMOTU) algorithms. It subsequently describes the implementation, and structural attributes of the Barcode Index Number (BIN) system. Aside from a pragmatic role in biodiversity assessments, BINs will aid revisionary taxonomy by flagging possible cases of synonymy, and by collating geographical information, descriptive metadata, and images for specimens that are likely to belong to the same species, even if it is undescribed. More than 274,000 BIN web pages are now available, creating a biodiversity resource that is positioned for rapid growth.},

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance To avoid ambiguities and error, ethnopharmacological and any other research on plants requires precise and appropriate use of botanical scientific nomenclature. Aims This paper explores problems and impacts of ambiguous or erroneous use of botanical scientific nomenclature in ethnopharmacological studies. It suggests how the frequency and impact of such errors can be reduced. Approach and methods We assessed 214 articles published in the three first volumes of the Journal of Ethnopharmacology in 2012: 140(1) to 141 (3) and 214 articles in Phytomedicine (2012-2013): 19 (5) to 20 (7). Results Amongst the articles reviewed 308 articles cited plant names incorrectly. Among the articles studied 9178 Latin scientific names were cited and 3445 were incorrect in some respect. Simple principles applied in a systematic way and used together with open-access reference resources could help authors, referees and editors of ethnopharmacological, phytochemical, toxicological and clinical studies to reduce ambiguity about the identity and name of the species involved and thus significantly improve the quality of the final publication. Conclusions We have identified a series of key steps needed to solve the taxonomic ambiguities and errors. Aside from reinforcing existing policies, journals will have to implement better tools to ensure the proper authentication of materials. The new electronic publishing environments offer novel ways to develop such botanical-taxonomic tools. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {In an interesting contribution Joppa et al. (2011) revisit some aspects of the taxonomic impediment (Evenhuis 2007; http://www.cbd.int/gti/) and come to the conclusion that, contrary to the generally accepted idea, both the rates of species description and the number of taxonomists have increased exponentially since the 1950’s. Joppa et al. (2011) also note a marked decline in the number of species described per taxonomist which they attribute to the difficulty of finding new species in an ever declining ‘missing species pool’. Therefore, their results might be interpreted that today’s taxonomic workforce is sufficient to describe the remaining (shallow) ‘pool of missing species’. In this contribution, we question if this is indeed the case and propose a solution for speeding up taxonomic descriptions. We feel that Joppa et al. (2011) are overly enthusiastic, probably because their test cases represent a selection of the better-studied taxa (flowering plants, Conus snails, spiders, amphibians, birds and mammals). Contradicting the findings of Joppa et al. (2011) and using a much broader taxon sampling, which includes many poorly studied groups, Costello et al. (2011) observe that species description has roughly remained constant since the second World War, at least for terrestrial species. These results are congruent with other counts of species descriptions (Bacher 2012; Chapman 2009; May 2011; Zhang 2010; http://species.asu.edu/SOS). So it seems that the increasing rate of species description as reported by Joppa et al. (2011) is taxon specific rather than general. In stark contrast to the constant rate of species description is the rate with which species are discovered by using DNA sequence data. Exhaustive bio-inventory initiatives to map diversity of poorly explored areas around the world (e.g. http://laplaneterevisitee.org/; http://mooreabiocode.org) in combination with large-scale barcoding efforts (Hajibabei et al. 2007; Valentini et al., 2009) result in an explosion of species/sequences in repositories such as Genbank and Bold Systems that are not linked to known species. This growing number of what have been called ‘dark taxa’ by Page (http://iphylo.blogspot.com/2011/04/ dark-taxa-genbank-in-post-taxonomic.html), makes one question the use of proper taxonomic names at all. Indeed, it can be argued that a lot of biology does not per se require formally described taxon names. However, the value of scientific names exceeds the field of biology sensu stricto and matters},

abstract = {The Linnaean system of nomenclature has been used and adapted by biologists over a period of almost 250 years. Under the current system of codes, it is now applied to more than 2 million species of organisms. Inherent in the Linnaean system is the indication of hierarchical relationships. The Linnaean system has been justified primarily on the basis of stability. Stability can be assessed on at least two grounds: the absolute stability of names, irrespective of taxonomic concept; and the stability of names under changing concepts. Recent arguments have invoked conformity to phylogenetic methods as the primary basis for choice of nomenclatural systems, but even here stability of names as they relate to monophyletic groups is stated as the ultimate objective. The idea of absolute stability as the primary justification for nomenclatural methods was wrong from the start. The reasons are several. First, taxa are concepts, no matter the frequency of assertions to the contrary; as such, they are subject to change at all levels and always will be, with the consequence that to some degree the names we use to refer to them will also be subject to change. Second, even if the true nature of all taxa could be agreed upon, the goal would require that we discover them all and correctly recognize them for what they are. Much of biology is far from that goal at the species level and even further for supraspecific taxa. Nomenclature serves as a tool for biology. Absolute stability of taxonomic concepts-and nomenclature-would hinder scientific progress rather than promote it. It can been demonstrated that the scientific goals of systematists are far from achieved. Thus, the goal of absolute nomenclatural stability is illusory and misguided. The primary strength of the Linnaean system is its ability to portray hierarchical relationships; stability is secondary. No single system of nomenclature can ever possess all desirable attributes: i.e., convey information on hierarchical relationships, provide absolute stability in the names portraying those relationships, and provide simplicity and continuity in communicating the identities of the taxa and their relationships. Aside from myriad practical problems involved in its implementation, it must be concluded that "phylogenetic nomenclature" would not provide a more stable and effective system for communicating information on biological classifications than does the Linnaean system.},

Finally, the special issue closes with a series of research and review papers that provide detailed use cases illustrating how these research infrastructures are being put into practice. Highlights from this section include citizen science approaches to collecting species information by the COMBER Marine observation network (Arvanitidis et al. 2011) and the Australian Bush Blitz programme (Lambkin and Bartlett 2011); use of new tools for data publishing like the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) and the DRYAD Data Repository; new forms of publication via ?data papers? that allow checklists and identification keys to be formally published as structured datasets (e.g., Narwade et al. 2011); and finally new taxonomic revisions and species descriptions constructed from within the collaborative systems like XPER2 and Scratchpads.},

This paper reviews and discusses the use of natural language processing (NLP) and machine-learning algorithms to extract information from systematic literature. NLP algorithms have been used for decades, but require special development for application in the biological realm due to the special nature of the language. Many tools exist for biological information extraction (cellular processes, taxonomic names, and morphological characters), but none have been applied life wide and most still require testing and development. Progress has been made in developing algorithms for automated annotation of taxonomic text, identification of taxonomic names in text, and extraction of morphological character information from taxonomic descriptions.

abstract = {Research on syntax and parsing played a central role in the cognitive revolution and continues to occupy a central position in the study of language. While linguistically driven theories of syntactic representation have not proven sufficient to predict and explain the full range of experimental outcomes, they have provided invaluable insights to language researchers. Greater success has been achieved by combining insights from linguistics and cognitive psychology. Such approaches began to emerge in the 1970s, with the advent of serial, modular, syntax-first approaches, such as the garden-path theory, that were computationally tractable and plausible given human resource limitations. The ‘second wave’ of syntactic parsing theories arose as an important component of connectionist/neural network-inspired research in the 1980s and 1990s. These accounts differed from first-generation accounts in that they viewed syntactic parsing as being one component of a massively interactive parallel-processing system. According to such accounts, the parser responds to a wide variety of lexical and contextual influences, and evidence for such effects can be found in experiments involving verb subcategory preferences, lexical-semantic properties of words in important syntactic positions, and discourse and visual context. Recent emerging theories have added new perspectives by focusing on multiple cues to meaning, redundancy at lexical-semantic and syntactic levels of analysis, the importance of anticipatory processes, and the importance of experience in adult comprehenders. Thus, parsing theory continues to evolve and we can expect this area of inquiry to remain lively for the foreseeable future.},

While on the surface this sounds like a reasonably minor step in the pathway to the new taxonomy, the logical implications of this proposal are many and far reaching. For example, this change may lead to further advances so that zoological taxonomy bypasses traditional journal publication entirely, with ZooBank or some other electronic web-based outlet operating as the publishing vehicle and names register for the new taxonomy. While electronic publication is an important step in improving taxonomic practice, it is by no means a panacea for the critical shortage of taxonomic expertise in Australia or elsewhere.},

abstract = {Whatman 3MM paper was chemically modified to generate nickel-charged iminodiacetic acid paper (Ni2+-IDA paper). Bacteria were transformed with Escherichia coli expression plasmids coding for either unmodified proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) or PCNA containing a genetically engineered polyhistidine tract (his-tag) located at its NH2 terminus. They were then grown, induced, and lysed, and macromolecules were transferred to Ni2+-IDA paper. After exhaustive washing, his- tagged PCNA but not unmodified PCNA remained bound to the paper. Moreover, bound his-tagged PCNA was biochemically active in an in situ DNA synthesis assay with exogenous template-primer and purified calf thymus DNA polymerase delta (pol delta). Ni2+-IDA paper was used to identify a PCNA- point mutant that, relative to wild-type PCNA, promotes increased DNA synthesis by pol delta beyond a model abasic template site. In addition, metal-charged IDA paper promises to be generally useful for functional screening of cells expressing cloned proteins. Copyright 1999 Academic Press.},

                 information.pdf:pdf",
  abstract =     "The need for a names-based cyber-infrastructure for
                 digital biology is based on the argument that
                 scientific names serve as a standardized metadata
                 system that has been used consistently and near
                 universally for 250 years. As we move towards
                 data-centric biology, name-strings can be called on to
                 discover, index, manage, and analyze accessible digital
                 biodiversity information from multiple sources. Known
                 impediments to the use of scientific names as metadata
                 include synonyms, homonyms, mis-spellings, and the use
                 of other strings as identifiers. We here compare the
                 name-strings in GenBank, Catalogue of Life (CoL), and
                 the Dryad Digital Repository (DRYAD) to assess the
                 effectiveness of the current names-management toolkit
                 developed by Global Names to achieve interoperability
                 among distributed data sources. New tools that have
                 been used here include Parser (to break name-strings
                 into component parts and to promote the use of
                 canonical versions of the names), a modified TaxaMatch
                 fuzzy-matcher (to help manage typographical,
                 transliteration, and OCR errors), and Cross-Mapper (to
                 make comparisons among data sets). The data sources
                 include scientific names at multiple ranks; vernacular
                 (common) names; acronyms; strain identifiers and other
                 surrogates including idiosyncratic abbreviations and
                 concatenations. About 40\% of the name-strings in
                 GenBank are scientific names representing about 400,000
                 species or infraspecies and their synonyms. Of the
                 formally-named terminal taxa (species and lower taxa)
                 represented, about 82\% have a match in CoL. Using a
                 subset of content in DRYAD, about 45\% of the
                 identifiers are names of species and infraspecies, and
                 of these only about a third have a match in CoL. With
                 simple processing, the extent of matching between DRYAD
                 and CoL can be improved to over 90\%. The findings
                 confirm the necessity for name-processing tools and the
                 value of scientific names as a mechanism to
                 interconnect distributed data, and identify specific
                 areas of improvement for taxonomic data sources. Some
                 areas of diversity (bacteria and viruses) are not well
                 represented by conventional scientific names, and they
                 and other forms of strings (acronyms, identifiers, and
                 other surrogates) that are used instead of names need
                 to be managed in reconciliation services (mapping
                 alternative name-strings for the same taxon together).
                 On-line resolution services will bring older scientific
                 names up to date or convert surrogate name-strings to
                 scientific names should such names exist. Examples are
                 given of many of the aberrant forms of ‘names’ that
                 make their way into these databases. The occurrence of
                 scientific names with incorrect authors, such as
                 chresonyms within synonymy lists, is a quality-control
                 issue in need of attention. We propose a
                 future-proofing solution that will empower stakeholders
                 to take advantage of the name-based infrastructure at
                 little cost. This proposed infrastructure includes a
                 standardized system that adopts or creates UUIDs for
                 name-strings, software that can identify name-strings
                 in sources and apply the UUIDs, reconciliation and
                 resolution services to manage the name-strings, and an
                 annotation environment for quality control by users of
                 name-strings.",
